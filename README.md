# Remote-Access-software-little-project
A little project for a "remote" access software I have been working on lately.


This will be one of my "Bigger" projects as it reaches alot of areas that I am interested in, and in general I like this type of stuff.
For now I will try to keep regular commits if I can, but if I cant you will see that, if you have any code-quality or any other suggestions please point them out,
thanks for the support, and hope you enjoy reading my "code".

Thank you for your passion and support!

I also wanted to add that this is not for malicious use at all, all testing will be done under permission of my friends which trust me and we have been friends for years, just for some people that might be confused.
