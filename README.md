# Remote-Access-software-little-project
A little project for a "remote" access software I have been working on lately.


This will be one of my "Bigger" projects as it reaches alot of areas that I am interested in, and in general I like this type of stuff.
For now I will try to keep regular commits if I can, but if I cant you will see that, if you have any code-quality or any other suggestions please point them out,
thanks for the support, and hope you enjoy reading my "code".

Thank you for your passion and support!
